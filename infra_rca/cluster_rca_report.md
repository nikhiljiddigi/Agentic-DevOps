# RCA Report for Node: `ip-172-31-5-67`
### ðŸ§© Category: Application

## ðŸ§  Root Cause
CoreDNS deployment failure or misconfiguration, leading to cluster-wide DNS resolution issues and subsequent pod scheduling failures.

## ðŸ’¡ Reasoning
The node `ip-172-31-5-67` reports as `Ready: True` with sufficient memory and disk, and current resource metrics show very low CPU (64m) and Memory (1%) usage, contradicting the `NodeDiskPressure` and `NodeMemoryPressure` signals. The primary issue

# RCA Report for Service: `kubernetes` (Namespace: `default`)
### ðŸ§© Category: Infra

## ðŸ§  Root Cause
The Kubernetes API server process on the control plane host `172.31.5.67` is unhealthy or not running, causing the `kubernetes` service endpoint to be unavailable.

## ðŸ’¡ Reasoning
The `kubernetes` Service, which exposes the API server, reports `UnavailableReplicas`. This service relies on a single, statically configured endpoint `172.31.5.67:6443`. The provided metrics for `ip-172-31-5-67` show unusually low CPU and memory usage, strongly suggesting the `kube-apiserver` process is not actively running or has crashed on that host, thus making the service endpoint unreachable.

## ðŸ›  Recommendations
- SSH into the control plane host `172.31.5.67`.
- Check the status of the `kube-apiserver` process (e.g., using `systemctl status kube-apiserver` or `crictl ps` if running as a static pod/container).
- Review `kube-apiserver` logs on `172.31.5.67` for errors, crash reports, or startup failures.
- If the process is down, attempt to restart it.
- Investigate underlying host issues (e.g., disk space, network connectivity from the host itself) if the process fails to start or crashes repeatedly.
